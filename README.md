# CASU is an arcade-style gaming application created by us, for you, for FREE!

Casu means by chance, and was manifested & curated by Steven, Ibraim, Edna & Joshua.

This app was designed to be easy to navigate, play, and have to have fun!


## Getting Started

1. Our Site features 1 game for version 1 

2. The game featured is Rock Paper Scissors

3. To fully enjoy this site, sign up! 

4. To sign up, create a username, add an email, and create a password and click the signup button. Then you'll be routed to your profile page where you can play Rock Paper Scissors. Our app saves your login information for future use, and all scores will be saved to our database so that each time you log in, your win and loss records will be preserved. 

5. If you win a round of Rock Paper Scissors, your victory will be celebrated & confetti will rain down on you (to the victor goes the spoils!!!).
 
6. Have fun & enjoy!

## Future Development

During future development we will develop a dice game, arm wrestling, tic tac toe, a horse racing game, a leaderboard, and a comment page so that players can interact and compete with eachother.
